SolidShell - 3-dimension elasticity FE analysis program.
  Element types  : 3-dimension 8-node solid shell element.
  Problem solved : 3-dimension plane whose Young's modulus and Poisson's rate are known
    is deformed at nodal forces.

Usage:
   >>> SolidShell file_name
or
   $ python SolidShell.py file_name
